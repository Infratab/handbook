#### Task Management with Wunderlist

>Don't bother once completed

- Wunderlist tasks carry a very short shelf life
- Wunderlist tasks are meant for only handling the current and the prospective contexts of the work taken up in our office
- Wunderlist tasks are primarily meant for
  - **Prioritizing work:**  Involves scheduling the urgency of the tasks as well as deferring the todos for the future
  - **Managing daily standups:** All the works mentioned in a daily standup should be a wunderlist task
  - **Time management:** 

#### Creating and completing a wunderlist task

>Created by anyone. Completed by the one who worked on it

- Wunderlist tasks can and should be created by anyone who understands the need for that particular task. Asking somebody else to create a task should be avoided.
- Before creating a wunderlist task, do spend a few minuted to confirm that it will not become a duplicate of another already existing task.
- The titles of the tasks can be changed/updated any number of time.
- Tasks can be merged or removed by anyone once they broadcast using "@everyone" on why they are doing so
- There can be any number of wunderlist tasks created - the range of the scope of work for any task is left to the discretion of the person who is working on the task (assignee)

>For instance, A creates a task and assigns B to it. B can always look up the task and then decide to break it into multiple tasks with a smaller scope of work, or vice versa, B can decide that multiple existing wunderlist tasks can be made into one single task



#### Assigning a Task

- Assignment of wunderlist tasks signifies that the ownership of the task rests with the assignee. 
- This assignment can be passed around depending on 
  - the evolving needs of the office,
  - the urgency of the work involved, and
  - the availability of the assignee    
- However, in such cases the current assignee and the new assignee should agree upon this change in assignment and the same be           broadcasted to the entire office.

#### Due Dates

>Every wunderlist task should have a due date assigned.

- It is recommended to provide due dates, even if they are tentative for tasks that are being planned to be completed within the near and foreseeable future.
- Due dates of wunderlist tasks thus tentatively framed can and in fact should be regularly updated based on the evolving work situtaion of the assignee as this provides a rough outline of the work being planned for the next few days by the assignee.
- Tasks which have not been completed within the due date, should be updated with their status by a comment and then the due date updated.
